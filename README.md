# License Plate Removal
Playing around with OpenCV. Made its way into a detailed [tutorial](https://medium.com/@leo.ertuna/license-plate-removal-with-opencv-6649a3ac54e2).

To follow the tutorial take a look at `step_{number}_{description}.py` files. 

To check the resulting cleaned-up script see `main.py` with most of OpenCV related methods moved to `helpers.py`
